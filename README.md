Repository holding rust Pico W project that connects to wifi and accepts requests on port 1234.
If request path ends with /on it turns gpio 7/8/9 HIGH, if the path ends with /off it sets it to LOW. Whole purpose of this small repo is having a way to make my stream donations visible on camera with external equipment.
